# From this project, I learned how to build a multifunctional organizer application that includes:

1. A Pomodoro timer with customizable work and break durations, the ability to start and stop sessions, automatic switching between work and break cycles, and audio notifications with adjustable volume.
2. A To-Do List that allows users to add, remove, and filter tasks by status (all, active, completed), with all tasks and their completion states persisting in localStorage even after page reloads.
3. A feature-rich calculator with basic and advanced operations, real-time expression editing, error handling, and a clean, interactive interface.
4. A Password Generator capable of creating secure random passwords with customizable length and character sets, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, with one-click copy functionality.
5. A Weather module that lets users search for cities, fetch detailed weather data from an external API, and view current conditions, hourly forecasts, and a 3-day outlook, with error handling, debounced search, and asynchronous loading via Vue's Suspense.
6. I also learned how to implement responsive design by using CSS media queries, ensuring the interface adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.
